# Zombie
Zompbie apocalypse

In this mini-project, I have created a simulation of zombies and humans interacting on a grid. As in the movies, my zombies are hungry for human brains. As a result, zombies chase humans and humans flee from zombies. To keep my simulation manageable, the positions of the zombies and humans will be restricted to a grid.
In my simulation, zombies are not very agile and can only move up, down, left, or right in one step of the simulation. On the other hand, humans are more agile and can move in these four directions as well as the four neighboring diagonal directions. 
If a zombie catches a human by positioning itself in the same cell, the zombie enjoys some delicious human brains.
The main idea is to compute a simple approximation of the distance from each cell in the grid to the nearest zombie (or human). This distance will correspond to the length of the shortest sequence of adjacent grid cells (a path) from the cell to a zombie, this distance field was computed using breadth-first search.

So, have fun and enjoy some "Brains!"
